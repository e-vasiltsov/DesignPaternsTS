## Installation
You should look at and run the tests to see what happens in the example.
To do this, you should install dependencies with `Yarn` first:

```bash
$ yarn
```

Read more about how to install and use `Yarn` on your local machine [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable).

To run the tests run command:

```bash
$ yarn test
```
